# Triad_Dish_System
The Triad Dish System is a smart-home appliance powered by three coordinated robotic arms positioned consecutively on a kitchen tabletop. Working together, the system automates the full dishwashing cycle: picking up dirty dishes from a designated pile, scrubbing them clean, drying them, and finally placing them neatly into the cupboard.
